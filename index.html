        <h2>History</h2>
          <p>In 1855 several German immigrant families left St. Jacobs, Ontario, Canada for
          Minnesota. These families were members of the Evangelical Church in Canada and shortly
          after settling in Minnesota they requested that the Evangelical Church in Canada send a
          pastor to Minnesota. In November, 1856, Andrew Tarnutzer, the first Evangelical minister in
          Minnesota, arrived in Winona, Minnesota and by February, 1857, he arrived in St. Paul. On
          March 2, 1857, Rev. Tarnutzer organized the first Evangelical class of members of the
          Evangelical Association in America, which became known as the Salem Evangelical Church.</p>
          <p>From 1857 until 1874, a small building across the road from its present site was the
          place of worship. This small frame building had siding that ran up and down, two windows,
          one door, and several wooden benches. In 1874 H. E. Bunse became pastor to both
          Emanuel Evangelical Church at Pine and 11th</p>
          <p>Evangelical Church. Rev. Bunse began construction of the current building on farm land
          donated by the one of the original families from Germany. The church measures 20 feet six
          inches by 32 feet six inches, has a hall or tower entrance of five feet by seven feet, and
          measures fourteen feet from the stone foundation to the eaves with a tower of
          approximately 30 feet. Farmers and people in the neighborhood helped in the construction.
          Before the present building was completed, Rev. Bunse was elected presiding elder of
          Emanuel Evangelical Church. Rev. Ernest Hielscher was assigned to Salem Evangelical
          Church.</p>
          <p>The first camp meeting was held on a neighboring farm between July 1st 1857.
          It was reported that there were seven tents erected, two covered wagons, and that
          there were nine conversions. The second camp meeting was held in 1858 and there were
          thirteen conversions. These 22 conversions, along with the original families, comprised the
          charter members. Among the first members of the Salem Kirche, were: Michael Gackstetter,
          Adam Laschinger, Jacob Binder, Jacob Bosshardt, George Glassing, Frederick Goldberg,
          Frederick Wm. Goldberg, C. F. Kachel, John Kochendorfer, Heinrich Schafer, Gottfried
          Schmidt, John Simon, and Frederick Zehnder.</p>

          <p>Salem Evangelical Church held continuous worship services until 1910, at which time
          most of its families migrated to the Winifred Street Church (now Faith United Methodist
           Streets in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Salem
          Church in West St. Paul), with some of the families moving to the West Side Community
          Church (now a part of St. Paul’s United Methodist Church in Mendota Heights) and the Zion
          Methodist Episcopal Church down the road (now Salem United Methodist Church). After its
          closing, ownership was continued as a historical site by the Evangelical church formed in
          1922, by the Evangelical United Brethren church formed in 1946, and lastly by the United
          Methodist church formed in 1968. Until the late 1960’s when Dakota County renamed
          streets this road was known as Salem Church Road. It remains the only street in Dakota
          County to have two historic churches, both named Salem on the same road. Salem Church
          Road still exists within the boundaries of the City of Sunfish Lake.</p>
          <p>After 1910, the church building and cemetery fell into disrepair. In the 1930’s a group
          of interested people organized a committee to provide for the care and upkeep of the
          building and cemetery grounds. Arthur Schlukebier was elected president and Christian J.
          Zehnder became secretary-treasurer. In 1976, Old Salem Shrine, as it has become known,
          became an Historic Site of the United Methodist Church. An ongoing committee continues
          today comprised of 16 members, primarily descendants of the original founders.</p>

          <p>Since 1955 the committee has held an Annual Founder’s Day service on the first
          Sunday in June, and in 1998 began an Epiphany Service on the first Sunday in January. The
          potbelly wood-burning stove is used to heat the building for winter events. The original
          pump organ is still in the church and used at these worship services. Each year there are
          weddings, family reunions, tours, and other special occasions held at the church. The church
          building, cemetery, and the grounds capture the local color of a rural atmosphere and a
          sense of heritage of pioneer courage and steadfast faith in God. The church and adjoining
          cemetery reveal a great deal about the history of Dakota County, MN between the 1700s and
          the present.</p>
