        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>In 1855 several German immigrant families left St. Jacobs, Ontario, Canada for
        Minnesota. These families were members of the Evangelical Church in Canada and shortly
        after settling in Minnesota they requested that the Evangelical Church in Canada send a
        pastor to Minnesota. In November, 1856, Andrew Tarnutzer, the first Evangelical minister in
        Minnesota, arrived in Winona, Minnesota and by February, 1857, he arrived in St. Paul. On
        March 2, 1857, Rev. Tarnutzer organized the first Evangelical class of members of the
        Evangelical Association in America, which became known as the Salem Evangelical Church.</p>

        <p>From 1857 until 1874, a small building across the road from its present site was the
        place of worship. This small frame building had siding that ran up and down, two windows,
        one door, and several wooden benches. In 1874 H. E. Bunse became pastor to both
        Emanuel Evangelical Church at Pine and 11th
        Evangelical Church. Rev. Bunse began construction of the current building on farm land
        donated by the one of the original families from Germany. The church measures 20 feet six
        inches by 32 feet six inches, has a hall or tower entrance of five feet by seven feet, and
        measures fourteen feet from the stone foundation to the eaves with a tower of
        approximately 30 feet. Farmers and people in the neighborhood helped in the construction.
        Before the present building was completed, Rev. Bunse was elected presiding elder of
        Emanuel Evangelical Church. Rev. Ernest Hielscher was assigned to Salem Evangelical
        Church.</p>

        <p>The first camp meeting was held on a neighboring farm between July 1st
        1857. It was reported that there were seven tents erected, two covered wagons, and that
        there were nine conversions. The second camp meeting was held in 1858 and there were
        thirteen conversions. These 22 conversions, along with the original families, comprised the
        charter members. Among the first members of the Salem Kirche, were: Michael Gackstetter,
        Adam Laschinger, Jacob Binder, Jacob Bosshardt, George Glassing, Frederick Goldberg,
        Frederick Wm. Goldberg, C. F. Kachel, John Kochendorfer, Heinrich Schafer, Gottfried
        Schmidt, John Simon, and Frederick Zehnder.</p>

        <p>Salem Evangelical Church held continuous worship services until 1910, at which time
        most of its families migrated to the Winifred Street Church (now Faith United Methodist
        Church in West St. Paul), with some of the families moving to the West Side Community
        Church (now a part of St. Paul’s United Methodist Church in Mendota Heights) and the Zion
        Methodist Episcopal Church down the road (now Salem United Methodist Church). After its
        closing, ownership was continued as a historical site by the Evangelical church formed in
        1922, by the Evangelical United Brethren church formed in 1946, and lastly by the United
        Methodist church formed in 1968. Until the late 1960’s when Dakota County renamed
        streets this road was known as Salem Church Road. It remains the only street in Dakota
        County to have two historic churches, both named Salem on the same road. Salem Church
        Road still exists within the boundaries of the City of Sunfish Lake.</p>


        <p>After 1910, the church building and cemetery fell into disrepair. In the 1930’s a group
        of interested people organized a committee to provide for the care and upkeep of the
        building and cemetery grounds. Arthur Schlukebier was elected president and Christian J.
        Zehnder became secretary-treasurer. In 1976, Old Salem Shrine, as it has become known,
        became an Historic Site of the United Methodist Church. An ongoing committee continues
        today comprised of 16 members, primarily descendants of the original founders.</p>

        <p>Since 1955 the committee has held an Annual Founder’s Day service on the first
        Sunday in June, and in 1998 began an Epiphany Service on the first Sunday in January. The
        potbelly wood-burning stove is used to heat the building for winter events. The original
        pump organ is still in the church and used at these worship services. Each year there are
        weddings, family reunions, tours, and other special occasions held at the church. The church
        building, cemetery, and the grounds capture the local color of a rural atmosphere and a
        sense of heritage of pioneer courage and steadfast faith in God. The church and adjoining
        cemetery reveal a great deal about the history of Dakota County, MN between the 1700s and
        the present.</p>
